# Winter Spices

A simple, minimalist, cozy theme.

Good for writing long text and journalling.

Used fonts: Georgia, YU Gothic

It will look the same in light and dark mode, but works best in light mode.

Update: After many months, I finally gave this theme a few small tweaks to make it more sleek and readable...
